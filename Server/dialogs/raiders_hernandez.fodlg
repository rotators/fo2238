{100}{}{Hernandez}
{200}{}{You see Hernandez.}
{210}{}{You see a younger raider. He doesn't look like he's been here that long, but the signs of the lifestyle are already apparent.}
{240}{}{You see Hernandez's corpse.}
{250}{}{You see Hernandez's lifeless body slumped on the floor.  Guess he never got to meet his sister again.  Poor guy.}
{260}{}{You see Hernandez's corpse.}
{270}{}{Wow, someone really did a number on Hernandez.  You can recognise a few anatomical features, but it's mostly a horrific mess.}
{1000}{}{Predialogue installations}
{1010}{}{dumb floats}
{1020}{}{No raider}
{1030}{}{Raider, first meeting}
{1040}{}{Raider, second meeting, not started the quest}
{1050}{}{Started quest, not met sister yet}
{1060}{}{Finished quest, poor outcome}
{1070}{}{Finished quest, good outcome}
{1080}{}{Friendly floats}
{2000}{}{Who the fuck are you?@@The fuck are you?@@What are you looking at?@@You look like a punk@@You look like a bitch@@You look like a wimp@@You look like a faggot@@Get the fuck outta here@@Gimme some jet or fuck off@@Look at me again and I'll kick your head in, dick@@Go fuck yourself@@Fuck off@@Who the fuck is this guy?@@Look at what the cat dragged in...a shithead@@Who's this asshole?@@Fuck off, shithead@@Get lost, no dick@@Fuck yourself, asshole@@Wanna feel my foot in your face?@@Wanna feel my cock in your ass?@@Dickhead@@Asshole@@Shithead@@Why don't you dickheads walk all the way home?}
{3000}{}{Hm?  Watchu want, man?}
{3010}{}{I got nothin goin on, let's chew the fat.}
{3020}{}{Nuthin.}
{4000}{}{Alright, I guess.  New guy, right?  How'd you take the switch from everyday sucker to bad ass motherfucker?}
{4010}{}{I don't know.  Shit's different now, but fuck it, right?}
{4020}{}{I was born for this!}
{4030}{}{I think I'm having some second thoughts.}
{4040}{}{You don't look like a bad ass motherfucker,}
{4050}{}{Uh, yeah sure it was ok.  I gotta go, though, Later.}
{5000}{}{Yeah, it's a big change alright, but you gotta roll with it and accept the consequences.  Turns out I wasn't prepared for one of mine, though.}
{5010}{}{Yeah? What happened?}
{5020}{}{Maybe you made the wrong decision joining up.}
{5030}{}{This is a great story but I'm bored out of my fucking mind.  Bye.}
{6000}{}{Don't get too confident.  Sure, a lot of people became raiders because they had nothing to lose, and we capture a lot of kids who grow up into raiders, but some of us leave
things behind...}
{6010}{}{And you're one of those people?}
{6020}{}{I suppose that's true.  I gotta be some place though.  Bye.}
{7000}{}{Yeah, that's common.  It's a big change.  Cut yourself off from the rest of the world pretty much.  Most of us probably look like we don't give a fuck, but I wish I could go
back and sort out one last thing.}
{7010}{}{Yeah?  Me too I guess.  What did you leave unsettled?}
{7020}{}{Should have thought that through before you signed up.  I have to split, though.}
{8000}{}{Hey man fuck you.  Everyone carries it in different ways.  I've killed more fuckers than you could even dream of.  Get outta my face.}
{8010}{}{Er, right.}
{9000}{}{Well like, like most of these guys, I joined up cause I didn't have much else.  But I did have something.  A sister in Klamath.  Lucy. We weren't really close or nothin, but
we didn't hate each other neither.  We were still family.  I lived in Modoc, so I only saw her on caravans once a month or somethin.  And then one day I'm just not there.  
Never told her, dropped any hints or nothin.  Guess I'm wondering if she's okay.}
{9010}{}{You know, I'm new.  I'm not known, and you can't clock me for a Raider like you can the other guys.  I could go to Klamath and see how she was for you.}
{9020}{}{That's rough man.  Try not to let it hang over you though.  Good luck with that.  Later.}
{10000}{}{You'd do that?  Just find her, talk to her, see if she's okay.  Don't tell her I'm a raider though, no way.  That would fuck it all up anyway.  Say I'm dead or something, or
just don't mention me at all probably.  Make somethin up.  Fuck it, I don't know.  Just go talk to her and tell me how she is.}
{10010}{}{All right, I can do that.  See you when I get back.}
{10020}{}{I gotta take a raincheck on that.  I'll give you a shout later if I get a free minute.}
{11000}{}{Hey man, how's it going?}
{11010}{}{Yeah, you know.}
{11020}{}{Alright.  I can't talk now though.}
{12000}{}{Yeah I know how it goes.  Can't get this problem of mine out of my head though.}
{12010}{}{Yeah? What problem?}
{12020}{}{Tough break.  Take it easy bro.  Later.}
{13000}{}{Hurry up and find her, man.  I can't have this hanging over me.}
{13010}{}{I'll get to it.}
{14000}{}{Hey, did you find her?  Tell me what happened.}
{14010}{}{Not so hot.  Turns out she's dead.}
{14020}{}{She's doing okay, man.  Don't sweat it.  She seems happy.}
{15000}{}{[He takes a deep breath and is quiet for a moment.]  "Fuck, man.  I wasn't there to protect her.  That's my fault.  I have to think about what I've done.  Give me some room huh?}
{15010}{}{No problem.}
{16000}{}{Yeah?  That's a load off my mind man.  Maybe one day I'll be able to see her again.  Thanks for taking care of this dog, I owe you one.}
{16010}{}{No problem.}
{17000}{}{Hey, did you find her? Tell me what happened,}
{17010}{}{Don't sweat it, she's doing good.  She knows that you can't come and see her, but I didn't tell her why.  She understands.  She says when you're ready, you should go visit her again.  She said she'll be waiting in Klamath for as long as it takes.}
{18000}{}{That's good news, dogg.  A load off my mind.  I guess when I'm older, I can go see her again.  Hey, thanks a million bro, have a party on me.}
{18010}{}{My pleasure.}
