# target being missed

{368600}{}{Whoa! Be careful with that you might hurt someone}
{368610}{}{Hey now! That almost hit me}
{368620}{}{Would it help if I painted a target on myself}
{368630}{}{Not even close}
{368640}{}{Excuse me, were you aiming at me?}
{368650}{}{That rock you hit wasn't even armed}
{368660}{}{I hope that wasn't your best shot}
{368670}{}{This is going to be easier than I thought}
{368680}{}{You better put that thing down before you hurt yourself}
{368690}{}{Ha! You missed me}
{368700}{}{Close, but not close enough}
{368710}{}{You should try aiming next time}
{368720}{}{My mother's a better shot than you}
{368730}{}{Your hands must be shaking pretty hard for you to miss}
{368740}{}{Now that was a wild shot}
{368750}{}{I didn't even have to dodge that one}
{368760}{}{Looks like you need more practice}
{368770}{}{Now that was a fatal mistake}
{368780}{}{Either I'm lucky or you're a bad shot}
{368790}{}{The safest spot to be is right in front of you}

{409200}{}{You got about ten seconds to surrender...}
{409210}{}{Seems we're always getting into one scrap after another...}
{409220}{}{Time to correct another mistake of mother nature...}
{409230}{}{The bomb shoulda weeded all you trash out...}
{409240}{}{I'm gonna beat your sorry ass into oblivion.}

{409430}{}{Gonna kill you, then kill you again...}
{409440}{}{I got your number, you little cocksucker...}
{409450}{}{You're a stubborn one...}
{409460}{}{Yellow-gut summabitch...}
{409470}{}{You ain't got the sand to take me down...}
{409480}{}{Gonna whale the holy, howling tar outta you...}

{409710}{}{Too bad YOU can't reload the game and try again...}
{409720}{}{That woulda connected if you had some skill.}
{409730}{}{Some advice: Next time, hit the target you're aiming at.}
{409740}{}{Close one...}
{409750}{}{Close one, but no cigar.}
{409760}{}{You ain't gonna get a second chance.}
{409770}{}{Slow ass sonuvabitch...}
{409780}{}{Looks like Cassidy's gonna have to show you how we do things in the big city.}
