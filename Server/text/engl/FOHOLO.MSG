{10}{}{FEV Experiment Disk}
{11}{}{Log Date March 21, 2075
Major Barnett has ordered experiments with batch 10-011 of panimmunity virion, which has been renamed FEV, for Forced Evolutionary Virus. His main concern is with the side effects of the quad-helix structure rather than its main effect of replicative stability. He believes the new structure is the next logical step for mammalian nuclei. Experiments with single-celled organisms is a great success. While their basal metabolism appears unchanged, their immunity to infection and radiation is exceeding all earlier expectations. Addendum: choroplasts seem unaffected by the virion. Further experiments on plant cells have been canceled by order of Major Barnett. 

Log Date May 9, 2075
We infected several species of flatworm with FEV. Within hours the worms had increased in size by 28%, and 39 separate viral contagions were resisted by the population. Each sample was allowed to continue for several generations, and the new DNA structure was successfully passed on to worm's progeny, although only asexual reproduction was noticed in the samples. Experiments with insects have had less success. Major Barnett has postponed these experiments until further notice. 

Log Date June 30, 2075
Several lab strains of white mice have been infected successfully with FEV. Again, an increase in size was noted within hours, and after 9 days all mice had stabilized at 31% larger than the control group. Dissection revealed the most increase in size in striated muscle tissue and certain internal organs, such as the liver, heart, and kidneys. In a surprising finding, the infected mice were found to run mazes in less than half of the time of the control group. More testing will be needed to confirm this finding as significant. 

Log Date November 9, 2075
We have infected 218 rabbits with FEV. Half of the subjects were implanted with electrodes to monitor EEG activity before and after the infection. Increased electrical activity in the brain was noted in 3.2 seconds (on average) after injection. Again, the typical size increase was noted. However, increased aggression and posturing (especially among males) was noted as well. Sacrifice and profusion yielded brain tissue that showed increased dendritic connection, especially in the limbic system and frontal cortex. 

Log Date January 12, 2076
With batch 11-011, we have improved the mitotic cycle efficiency by 43%. We have infected 53 raccoons with the new strain. In addition to the now expected size increase, behavioral tests confirmed an increase in intelligence and manual dexterity by 19 points on the Schuler-Kapp index. Unfortunately, several subjects escaped confinement and had to be hunted down and dispatched. Major Barneet ordered the remaining subjects terminated.Two pairs were unaccounted for. 

Log Date May 13, 2076
We have spliced several new gene sequences, supplied by Major Barnett's advisory team, into FEV. With batch 11-101a, we infected 23 dogs of both pure and mixed breed, and all experienced nearly immediate growth. The larger size was accompanied with increased aggressiveness, while no significant intelligence increase was noted. We plan to attempt crossover of 92 allele pairs with batch 11-011. All subjects were terminated after 14 weeks of study. 

Log Date October 4, 2076
The crossover has been completed and 15 chimpanzees were infected with batch 11-111. Growth and immunity levels are unprecedented. Attempts to induce cancers in the subjects through radiological and chemical agents were not successful. Increased aggressiveness have led to isolating the subjects. Two subjects suffered violent epileptic seizures and died. All remaining subjects terminated. 

Log Date January 7, 2077
Major Barnett has ordered transfer of all FEV research to the Mariposa Military Base. He plans to continue the project experiments on volunteer subjects. I am against this, and would like it noted here that research on human subjects is not recommended by myself or my staff.}

{31}{}{Capt. Maxson was right. This place is death. I'm writing this so that if we don't make it back, someone, some day, might find out what happened to us. 
We made it to West Tek Research Facility after 20 days of hell. But that was the easy part. The radiation levels began to shoot up as soon as we could see the giant crater. We checked our supplies and figured with our armor and our anti-rad supplies we'd be fine for a least a day of exploring. We felt it was a calculated risk, but the technology we had the potential of recovering was worth it. 
We climbed down the crater to the first level and everything seemed to be according to plan. The power was off, so we didn't need to circumvent the security. Or so we thought. There wasn't much of value on this level, so we pushed on. 
The second level was more of the same. 
When Jensen dropped to the third level, all hell broke loose. The security sensors had been burned out on the first two levels, but not on the third. Jensen was cut to ribbons before he knew what had happened. We'd never seen weapons cut through power armor like that. Men started dropping right and left, and the ones who were still alive lost it. I tried to regroup, but only Soto and Camarillo made it back up here to the first level with me. 
The fact that I can smell Soto's burning flesh where his arm was taken off means that my power armor is no longer air tight, so I'm sucking up a lot more rads than I had planned on. I'm leaking hydraulics at an alarming rate. We need to get far enough away from this place before my armor dies. 
Camarillo seemed fine physically, but he wandered off about an hour ago, mumbling something about Gehenna. That bastard has all the anti-rad. 
That leaves Soto and myself. We can't make it far enough away from here without the anti-rads, so I've got to try to find Camarillo before it's too late.

{41}{}{Prototype Panimmunity Virion Project

In the hopes of countering the current bacteriological and viral agents employed by the Chinese government, we have manufactured a virus fragment consisting of ribonucleic acid (RNA) encased in a protein-lipid sheath. This virion contains a specially arranged sequence of radiated amino acids (RAA) that are capable of attaching to non-specific binding sites on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and force a non-replicating mitosis to occur. The resulting host cell is left with a quadruple-helix DNA structure. 

Early tests are promising. The virion easily penetrates the cell membrane and attaches directly to the host DNA in the nucleus. Mitosis of the structure begins almost immediately. Cytokinesis is prevented by controlling the disposition of the kinetochore fibers during anaphase. The entire mitotic cycle lasts approximately 2 hours, although phenotypical expression of the new structure may take days or weeks to become apparent. 

In addition to an effective immunity to bacterial and viral agents, the quad-helix structure is almost entirely immune to errors introduced in base pairing during replication due to multiplicity of the base sequence. Radiation-exposed tissue showed no mutation in the base sequence and protein synthesis mechanisms in the ribosomes were unimpaired. 

Over 80% of the samples tissue contained quad-helix DNA. Most affected was muscle and bone tissue, as well as secretory cells, as these cells seem most receptive to virion. Sensory cells are the least affected. Surprisingly, even normally non-replicating nerve cells and nonsomatic cell were induced to begin mitosis. Further experiments will be necessary to determine the results on these cells.}

By manipulating the amplitude of the light waves and magnifying the frequency, we have been able to get lasers which will cut through a few feet of steel. Unfortunately, the power to do such a task has not been fully developed. We have other scientists looking into this.}

{61}{}{Initial Observations

This is truly amazing. Some of the Knights on a patrolling expedition came across an unusual creature. This creature appears to be humanoid, and quite possibly was once of a human state. However, there are many differences in the structure of this creature than that of normal humans. 
In the initial investigation of this creature, it is discovered to have a cellular structure akin to that of humans. Before any possible decomposition can take place, I am taking down the statistics of this subject. 


Statistics of Subject A

Height: 3.2 meters 
Mass: 363.21 kg 
Gender: Indeterminate 
Skin Colour: Predominantly gray with tints of green under the current lighting system. 
Uncertain if this is due to decay or exposure in the wastelands. 
Note: The skin is extremely tough with respect to scalpels. 

Mass Breakdown: 
Muscle Mass: 77.41% 
Bone Mass: 10.23% 
Fat Mass: 3.02% 
Tissue Mass: 9.34% 

Cellular Structure: Cells undergo cellular division at an increased rate. Mitosis occurs at a rate 15% quicker than that of normal humans. Cellular structure appears to be highly similar to humans.
Genetic structure shows a strong correlation between the subject and Homo Sapiens. Possible a mutation from the nuclear and biochemical agents remnant from the war. DNA strands appear to be very complete. All recessive genes for ailments appear to have been eradicated from the system. The RNA strands also appear to have been manipulated to allow for a greater transmission of signals.


Initial Hypothesis

Based on the increased size of the neural transmitters and synaptic receivers, I would hypothesize the subject had acute reflexes and heightened senses. Based on the reports the Knights gave of the area in which the subject was discovered, barren, high radiation, extremely high concentrations of chemical agents, it is a wonder the subject survived as long as it did. Performing tests to determine possible cause of death.


Results from tests conducted upon Subject A

Visual Inspection: Black powder burns near the area suggest possible bullet. 1.2 cm lacerations upon the calf of the right leg appear to have been made by teeth. Will conduct test for possible Rabies. Skin dried out and flaking. Possible exposure. 

Test Results: 
Radiation Count: 12 rads. 
Rabies test: Clean. 
Hydrochloric Gas: Clean 
Chlorine Level: .07% 
Sulfuric Content: .02% 
Phase Shifting Virus: Clean 
Gamma Cyclotronic Virus: Clean 
Forced Evolutionary Virus II: Severe overdose 


Hypothesis

Based on my observations, I would hypothesize that the test subject has been killed in a severe fight of at least two people and three animals the size of dogs. What is truly astonishing is the extent of viral infection in the subject. I had read once that some pre-war scientists were conducting experiments with such a virus, but all of the research notes were destroyed. 
Research into this virus has lead to many interesting discoveries. The test subject has gained many of its mutations from the overdose of the virus. This would account for the enhanced muscle and bone structure. Additionally, the recessive genes which are commonly found in humans have been manipulated in such a way as to bring about the best possible combination. While the process by which this happens is uncertain, it does have some severe side effects. Chief among them is sterility. The test subject would have been unable to reproduce with any creature, whether clean or mutated.Other side effects include an alteration of pigment of the epidermis. The life expectancy is increased by 10%. Intellect is decreased by this strain by 30%. 


Conclusions

Based on this information, I would extrapolate that we could simply outlive these mutants. However, based on the fact that these mutants have a super high concentration of the virus, it stands to reason that there could be some place which is creating them. As to where they could be, I cannot hazard a guess.}

{70}{}{Brotherhood Code}
{71}{}{Maxson's History 

My father was a security guard at a secret military base in the desert of southern California. A typical MP, I remember mostly his strength. When it came time for the revolution, I respected his convictions. He stayed behind, to help those who were disabled and wounded, even the scis. He put the well being of myself and my mother into the hands of his best friend, and ordered us into the desert with the other rebels. 

We, very few, marched into the wastes. The only thought on my mind was that I would never see my father again. He knew that to stay behind was death. And still, he stayed. He respected the flag, the CIC and the badge that he wore. 

What an idiot. 

He died for the sins of others. That will never happen again to us. We will become self-sufficient. We will become keepers of knowledge and lore. We will survive the end of civilization. We will take responsibility for our actions, and we will hold accountable the actions of others. 

This I pledge to you, Maxson, my son. The Brotherhood of Steel is justly named. We are a Brotherhood. Unlike my father, we will stand back to back with those that share our convictions and beliefs. We are Steel. We are hard. We have been sharpened to an edge. 

Always remember the fires that we were forged in. Never forget. The motto from a previous time, and our motto now.}

#{91}{}{The Exodus from the accursed base was a trying time for the men and their families. While there was no radioactive fallout to contend with, they were frequently beset by the fallout of humanity. Roving bands of psychotic marauders attempted several attacks on that noble group. 
#The company itself was in no danger, for they wore the Armor of Power. Members of their families were not so lucky. Once the vermin found out they were easily repelled, they began to fire on the unarmed civilians from a distance. 
#They took a great many casualties, yet for every member of the Exodus that was struck down in this way, our noble brethren took two lives from the wasteland. 
#Finally, the forefathers came to the safety of the bunker. Capt. Maxson, the great deliverer, decreed this to be our new home, and all was well. 
#In the fullness of time the bunker became our home, our temple and our salvation from the terrors of the outside world. We began to build and shape our fortress into something glorious, the beauty of which the technologically bereft world had never seen before. 
#Yet there were those who sought still more. These restless souls demanded we look to the southeast for the advanced technology that was supposedly housed there. 
#Capt. Maxson warned these impetuous youths that the research facility was doubtlessly destroyed when we were spared, but they would not hear his words.

{111}{}{0000 - 0004
I'm dying. I need to get this down before the pain overwhelms me. 

0005 - 0020
I can't believe that I was finally able to drag myself out of that vat. The slime did not affect me, but I nearly drowned. I don't know what happened to Harold - he was standing right next to me when the crane knocked me into the vat. He must have been killed or he would have tried to help me. Francine is dead, killed by one of those robots. 

0021 - 0027
I have no idea how much time has passed. I was able to hack the computer to turn off the robots and record this, but now my mind is slipping away.There is much pain... 

0028 - 0043
The green slime that I was immersed in is the source of all the mutations we traced to here. My skin is starting to fester and peel. In other areas it is bubbling and starting expelling a green mucus-like substance. Some days the pain is almost tolerable. 

0044 - 0057
I can actually walk a few steps again... It seems inconceivable that I dragged myself all the way up here from the vat room. Strangely, I'm actually feeling stronger, though I'm still in a lot of pain. Everything seems to be getting smaller. 

0058 - 0096
I think I consumed one of the mutated things scurrying around here today. Before I knew what was happening, some sort of tendril had sprang from my stomach and covered the poor creature. As soon as it had sucked the rodent into my gut I could actually feel its mind. I think. There is the very real possibility that I'm going slowly insane and can no longer differentiate between what is real and what is a hallucination. Maybe I'm still slowly dying in the vat and I've imagined all this. 

0097 - 0111
Things are becoming more clear to me every day. This toxin has actually improved my mind. I feel that I can understand even the most complex philosophical questions simply and directly. It's as if all the layers of artifice have been stripped away. I wonder what would happen if I submerged an animal in the vats for a prolonged period of time? Would it gain awareness? 

0112 - 0134
The strangest thing is happening to the animals. They actually become smarter and more aware of their surroundings. I dipped a dog and a rat at the same time today, and they were fused together. It's not quite two creatures anymore, but it's more than one. Perhaps this is the future - a coming together of different creatures in some sort of harmonious unity. I no longer consume the different animals I create simply for sustenance - I have become the instrument through which unity will be achieved. I am so much more than a human being now. 

0135 - 0139
It is time to bring others into the glory that is the Unity. 

0140 - 0153
A lost soul has finally strayed into my home. I was so surprised I consumed him before dipping, a mistake I shall not make again. His mind was so primitive as to be repulsive to my refined cognitive abilities. 

0154 - 0172
I've begun to modify myself to be more pleasing to the Unity by injecting small doses of the virus into my body. The slime in the vats is a man-made virus called the Forced Evolutionary Virus. This information was acquired from my newly grown neurolink with the base computer. 

0173 - 0198
The few wanderers that have found their way here have been a disappointment to me. They can't seem to mutate correctly. The best I've been able to create are some big and dumb mutants. Most can recall nothing from before I initiated them into the wondrous Unity. I only feed on them for fuel, now. Their minds are nothing to me. 

0199 - 0236
Oh glorious creator!! I have succeeded in spreading the complete joy of unification to another soul! Unlike the others, his total radiation count was low. I believe this is the factor we have been overlooking all this time, as it seems the conversion is more successful in the cases with less radiation damage. I have never known such glory as I felt when taking his mind into our own. 

0237 - 0281
We are beginning to create an army dedicated to unifying the wonderful diversity of life. We have trained them to continue our work here while we search out more populated areas to take into ourselves. We are beginning to feel the limitations of a body that is mobile. We must find a permanent home, with a greater store of knowledge, and a steady supply of bio-mass. 

0282 - 0303
We have stopped increasing ourself until we can find this new unification center. When we have arrived we will continue to grow and feed until we have brought peace and unity to the entire world.}

I, Roger Maxson, Captain, serial number 072389 have started this log because it doesn't look good for any of us, and I'd like for people to know what really happened here. 
All hell broke loose when we finally discovered what those scientist bastards were up to. The Colonel has locked himself in his office and seems to be having some sort of breakdown. The men are screaming for blood. They're looking to me for answers, and I'm not sure what to do. Someone has to do something, though, before this place sinks into an anarchistic bloodbath. 

Oct. 12 2077
Every time we get a report from higher up things get worse here. The war is going in a very bad direction and this place is about to go into full mutiny, with all the chaos that entails. I stopped one of the men from executing a scientist today, and demanded that we interrogate them to find out what their orders were. 

Oct.13 2077
I killed a man today. I was interrogating Chief Scientist Anderson and he was giving me the full details of their inhuman experiments. He said his orders came from the Gov't., but I didn't buy it. He started screaming about how he was following orders, how he was a military man, and I just shot him. I tell myself it was to keep him from causing a full mutiny among the men, but I'm not so sure. 

Oct.15 2077
I tried again to speak to the colonel through the door, but he seems to have completely lost touch with reality. I broke down the door with several of the men just in time to watch him blow his head off. Right before he pulled the trigger he said he was sorry. 

Oct. 18 2077
By killing the egghead, I seem to have confirmed my position as leader of the men. They follow me without question now. The interrogations invariably end up being executions. Shellman held out the longest, but the end result was the same. Her arguments about her orders were a bit too specific to be completely made up. I'm getting a real bad feeling in my gut about how this is all going to end up. I don't even lie to myself anymore about my reasons for executing the scientists. 

Oct.20 2077
I finally replied to the outside world over our radio. I don't know why they never sent anyone here to see what was happening when we stopped responding to their transmissions. It doesn't make any sense. Well, they'll come now. I declared ourselves seceeded from the union. They remember Jefferson Davis. What will history say about me? 

Oct.22 2077
What the hell is going on? We declare ourselves to be in full desertion from the army and no longer under the Government's command and what happens? Nothing. Something bad is coming down. 

Oct. 23 2077
I can't believe those bastards finally did it. Damn them all to hell. They finally let the A-Bombs fly. We were right in the middle of trying to pry the real story out of von Felden when we completely lost contact. I have a feeling the research center was hit hard. I don't know why, just call it a gut feeling. It seems inconceivable that we were not targeted. I'm sure China will make up for that oversight real soon. Luckily, we had moved our families from outside into the facility the day before yesterday. We do not yet know if the fallout has reached this area. 

Oct. 25 2077
Sgt. Platner volunteered to go outside today to take specific readings on the atmosphere. It seems the radiation has not spread this far. Since he was wearing his power armor, there was no threat to him from radiation, but if he had been exposed he would have had to be exiled. We don't have adequate decontamination facilities here. 

Oct. 26 2077
I convinced the men that we should bury the scientists. I don't know why... perhaps it was to ease my conscience. I finally started to believe their stories when the last one was dying. 
My God, what have I become? 

Oct. 27 2077
We're leaving this godforsaken place today. I'm leading the exodus to the old government bunker at Lost Hills. I'm leaving this log behind to be buried when this place goes in the next exchange. Who knows, maybe someone will find it someday.....}

{131}{}{2073
As China became increasingly aggressive with their use of biological weapons, the United States government felt that a countermeasure was needed. The Pan-Immunity Virion Project (PVP) was officially formed September 15, 2073. 

2075
It became clear that the best way to combat the newly created biological weapons was to alter uninfected DNA so that it was no longer susceptible to standard viral infection. 

2076
Unforseen side effects began surfacing in early 2076 with the PVP. Animal test subjects began showing an abnormal growth rate accompanied by increased brain activity. The U.S. government took notice of these discoveries, and in the interests of national security, moved a team on-site to secure and oversee the project, which was now dubbed the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus) project. 

2077
FEV nears completion. Test on lab animals are at a near 100% success rate. Size and muscle density increase approximately 60%, and the protential intelligence increase by 200%. Effects upon human subjects remain unknown; although they are theoretically promising. The military, wishing to continue further testing, builds a large facility at the Mariposa military installation in central California. At this new facility, testing of the FEV virus continues on volunteer subjects from the military.}

{160}{}{Vault Locations v34.129}
{161}{}{Hello, and welcome to the latest edition of the Western United States Vault Location Pamphlet. We hope you enjoy the pamphlet, and remember Vaults are not just for the upwardly mobile, but for everyone. 

Vault 12
Under the sprawling metropolis of Bakersfield, lies the technological magnificence of Vault 12. Built with every amenity in mind for the prospective Vault Dweller, Vault 12 was given the "Pressed Vault Suit" award for attention to preparedness. Buried far underground, the protection that Vault Dwellers will receive will be unprecedented. Much like all other Vaults, Vault 12 has been fitted with the newest in Vault Water Purification Systems. Able to take even the waste located in the sewers of Bakersfield, this system is able to deliver over 15,000 gallons of pure, refreshing drinking water every day.

Vault 13
Located in a scenic mountainous region northwest of Vault 12, this Vault offers an endless supply of pure water to the inhabitants. The rumors that the water table in the area could easily be contaminated in the event of a Nuclear War have been found by the Department of Water and Power to be completely unfounded. In the event that the water in the area were to become tainted, remote even though it may be, Vault 13 has been fitted with the government approved Vault Water Purification System. Rated to work without significant loss of output for over 250,000 hours, prospective Vault Dwellers should have nothing to fear. 

Vault 15
Due east from Vault 13, construction on this Vault has gone extremely smoothly. Much work was done to reinforce the walls of the third level of this Vault, to make all the future Vault Dwellers more secure in the knowledge that in the event of even a major earthquake, the regulatory computers of the Vault would continue to function. Recent tours of the newly constructed Vault, have had many a potential Vault Dweller walking away with a new found awe of the improvements done to this already impressive Vault.}

Increased levels of the FEV virus are present in both the air and soil samples we've taken. Luckily our suits filter out the virus. Tell the members of the Enclave they should have a pure sample of the mutagen soon.

Also, I've begun to notice some changes in the miners. They seem to be showing signs of increased strength, stamina and a slight change in skin tone; obvious signs of mutations by the FEV. The men are getting nervous, as they too have noticed the change. Although I've increased the number of guards, I fear if the workers completely mutate, we'll be vastly outnumbered. It is my hope, that since we are using the local inhabitants as a work force, full mutation won't occur unless they are directly exposed (dipped) in a pure source or prolonged exposure to the virus occurs. As you recall, minute amounts of the virus have been detected throughout this region. Tests on subjects living in this area have shown that they have built up a tolerance to the FEV virus. However, I advise caution since exposure to this level of the FEV virus was never entered into the calculations. I advise that you rig the entrance to the base to collapse as soon as a pure sample is obtained. This will seal the exposed miners into the base and prevent unfriendlies from obtaining the virus once we are gone.}

Personal Log

June 28, 2077
Today the boys in bio storage played a great joke on me. One of the little pranksters altered the settings on my Vault-Tec automated organ extractor. Boy, was I surprised when Private Callow came out of the operating room without a colon. Good thing he was dead already or I'd be in trouble. I hardwired the machine to extract only brains so this wouldn't happen again.  I'll get them back for this.

June 29, 2077
I removed Private Callow's liver and cooked it. I then had it sent down to the boys in bio storage with fava beans and a nice Chianti. They think it was a special thank you from the general for a job well done. I love my job.

June 30, 2077
I tried a new drug cocktail of Buffout and Psychos on one of my patients and mixed with some special enhancers I've been toying with. The results were promising, if not messy.  The subject became very violent and managed to break out of his room. Luckily, the new security robots were in place and managed to subdue him.  I'll have maintenance come down and replace that door.

July 1, 2077
My favorite experiment died.  I've been feeding him a steady diet of Mentats mixed with my special enhancers.  He went from an IQ of 39 to an IQ of 200 in just a few weeks.  I am saddened since he was one of the few people I could really talk to.  He will be sorely missed.

July 5, 2077
We think the new cybernetic brain is finally ready.  We have to run some more tests, but it looks promising.

July 6, 2077
Robotics isn't happy that their precious computer is being modified to run the base's security for the evacuation.  I can't say I'm happy either, since Skynet has been invaluable in the development of the new cybernetic brain.

July 9, 2077
The evacuation has been moved up. What rotten timing. We were just about to start on the installation of the new cybernetic brain. They say the evacuation is temporary, so I'll get to continue my research when I come back.  This will probably be my last log for some time, since I will be busy gathering up as much of my research as possible.}

Subject was attempting to arm an attack mine in storage bay as part of Sierra Army Depot's evacuation defenses.  Mine detonated prematurely severely injuring Corporal Dixon and General Clifton.  Corporal Dixon suffered severe lacerations to hands, chest and facial area. The entire right hand was completely severed and we were unable to locate the missing appendage. Severe puncture wounds to the chest and face area required extensive surgery to repair. 32 mine fragments were removed in all. Right eye was damaged beyond repair.  Surgery was performed to remove Corporal Dixon's right eye. It is our hope that by placing the damaged, but living eye in a new experimental Biomed gel, the eye might be able to regenerate itself. Hopefully we will be able to reattach the eye at a later date. This experimental Biomed gel shows great promise in stimulating growth in living cells. It is however unfortunate to test this new gel under such circumstances.}

Today's top story on GNN. In a financial coup, the US managed to be the first to tap the world's last remaining supply of oil. Until recently this reserve of oil was thought to be unattainable due to the deposit being located thousands of feet beneath the surface of the Pacific Ocean.
With the world's supply of oil nearing depletion, a race to be the first to create a method to extract this deposit ensued. We at the GNN are proud to announce that US is the first to do so and thus claim the oil as property of the United States. Way to go US!

China cries foul as news of the success circulates around the globe. According to President Xin of China, their drilling platform project was scheduled for completion months before the US project, however the Chinese platform had a string of unfortunate accidents delaying their project significantly.
President Xin is also quoted in saying that he has definitive proof that the US was behind the sabotage of their oil platform and formally requests that an international panel be appointed to investigate.

In other news, riots rock the nation as gasoline prices skyrocket to all time highs. Records were broken as the price of gas surpassed the current rate of gold bullion.

Here at home, the winter temperature is a chilly 100-110F with lows reaching a freezing 90F along the coast. Dress warmly today!

Negotiations between the US and other world powers has come to a dramatic end, with the President walking out of oil talks with the other world powers. After a much heated debate, the President stormed out of the meeting and declared that the last known supply of petroleum will be used exclusively by the US and the US will not sell or trade any oil to outside parties. Threats of UN sanctions fall on deaf ears.

Industry screeches to a halt across the globe as oil reserves are depleted. The cries of the desperate, however, do not fall upon deaf ears as exports from the US increase twentyfold despite UN sanctions. The US economy is seeing it's greatest growth since the Reagan Era.

{291}{}{Welcome!
Welcome to the Hubology Holodisc! Within these electronic pages, you'll find a quick description of our beliefs, including the formerly-repressed teachings of the Hub. This holodisc isn't meant to represent the final word on Hubology - think of it as a primer, and us as your spiritual guardians.

HISTORY
We were founded back before the Great Deluge by an author and visionary of great promise, a man named Dick Hubbell. He saw the failure of the medicine of that time, and of the failure of religion, and of the failure of government. He knew that the world needed something new...the world needed Hubology. Inspired by music of the time and hs own personal experience with extraterrestrial beings, he set out to show us wheels in the sky, to keep them burning, and to understand the Great Wheel of Life.

We call him the Hub, for it is through him that we understand our place in the Wheel - he is our center, and we are his spokes. It is around his teachings that we revolve.

With the publication of countless books and journals, the Hub began spreading the word of Hubology - and immediately became a target for his detractors. They called his work "pseudo-science" and "dangerous dribble that can only hurt its adherents." Despite the collected sightings of Extra-Terrestrial Vehicles across the globe, they insisted on quashing the Hub's word. We know that they were simply stupid and misguided, but they were powerful; they included governments and corporations and other such entities, keeping the greatest news of all time from the people of the earth.

Hubology was driven underground for a time, marshalling its forces against the attacks of those who envied its simplicity and ease of use for the common man. When at last the Hubologists of that time struck back,  they did it in such a way that few could stand against them - they infiltrated the  organizations that sought to destroy them and created "television" shows that sought to expose the lies the government had fed the people.

This caused a subtle backlash against our religion. The common man found reason to doubt Hubology because of the distorted teachings of the media, and we had to wage a long campaign against those who would call us crackpots. During this time, sadly, the great Hub passed away.

Bolstered by the knowledge that The Hub had achieved unity with the Star Father, helping to turn the cosmic wheel in our direction, attaining another level of consciousness, we remained confident in ourselves that ours was the true way. Along the way, we gained adherents, many of whom who simply wanted to believe that there was a place out there that is better than this world. We offer proof of life on other planets, and a philosophy that allows us to understand the way of the universe. People have come to us over the ages, impressed by the rightness of our minds. And the fact that we have survived the Great Deluge unscathed teaches us that the Great Wheel turns toward our teachings!

PHILOSOPHY
Hubology contains a simple philosophy, culled from the finest religious and philosophical minds of pre-Deluge Earth  -  we believe that life, the universe, and everything can best be symbolized by a turning wheel. The outer rim of wheel contains those who do not understand our teachings and who do not understand the truth. We call them "rim meat", for the Wheel turns over them and grinds them, and they do not appreciate its workings.

Those who practice Hubology are the Spokes of the Wheel. We understand the motion of the Wheel and do our best to facilitate its turning. Those who control a portion of the wheel are called Hubs - and as far as we know, there have been only a few Hubs, enlightened individuals who seek to better the lots of their fellow earthlings. We refer to the founder of Hubology as THE Hub, for he is the one with the most correct teaching.

In the practice of our religion, we simply apply scientific techniques developed by the Hub and perfected by his inheritors to align the flawed neurodynes that create disharmony and an asymmetrical wheel. This allows us to purify ourselves and prepare us for self-examination. It is only through self-examination that we are able to succeed, and only through self-examination that we understand our place in the cosmos and on the Great Wheel. It is only through self-examination that we discover ourselves to be worthy of boarding the fiery rings when they meet us on the planet Quetzel.

We think of ourselves as a religion combined with the best scientific technique - scientific spirituality is what we call it...and what we hope you'll be calling it before too long!

This is our creation story:
Aeons ago, all lived peacefully and in harmony with one another. Body, mind, and spirit were joined in all creatures, and the technology that existed boggled the imaginations. It was a time of peace, creativity, and alignment - and then the Dark Days came. Thrakazog the Pot Hole began to teach mind-body dualism and the sundering of the spirit, and war arose. The Great War destroyed souls and bodies and scattered their remnants across the universe. The Great Wheel came close to separating from the axle of existence, its spokes broken in the rut Thrakazog had created. A new life had to arise.

And arise it did, on the planet Terra, as on other planets across the universe. (We focus mainly on the life that arose on Terra, for while we blieve that we will once again heal the sundered spokes of the Wheel with our starry brothers, we must first concentrate on making ourselves useful spokes.) This new life was polluted by the soul-pieces of the dead. This led to hate and misunderstanding, and wars raged across Terra's surface until one day a visionary realized that the only way to create peace, understanding, and enlightenment was to cleanse these soul-pieces from the spirits of humanity. That visionary was The Hub. His cleansing continues today.

SMALL GLOSSARY
AHS/Aligned Hub Seeker: The levels of enlightenment are measured by the cleansing of your neurodynes, cleaning out the base negative energy of your meat and converting it to positive mental energy. When you have achieved a strong enough level of zetan energy, you can travel to Quetzel, or you can wait and hope that the Uplifting will come during your lifetime.

Alignment : When a neurodyne is polluted and keeps a seeker's Zeta levels down, we "align" the levels to the universal Wheel by  running a Zeta Scan on the affected neurodyne, cleansing it of taint. Too much alignment too quickly is harmful for the spirit, however.

Enlightenment: Enlightenment is the state achieved past AHS-9 - when the seeker has gained so much knowledge he becomes an integral part of the Great Wheel and leaves this earthly existence behind. Some of the Enlightened remain on Terra to guide the rest of us to a state of grace, to show us how to get behind the Wheel of our own lives.

Great Wheel: This refers to the cyclical nature of the universe, space, and time. Everything is a part of the Great Wheel. There are some who can take control of the Wheel - or perhaps they simply understand the direction in which it travels - and we call them gods, prophets, and visionaries. Those who master the Great Wheel are truly enlightened.

Neurodyne: Neurodynes are the stations of the spirit. Ancient religions called them "shakras". They can be polluted by soul-pieces and negative energy emanating from oppressives.

Oppressives: Oppressives are those individuals who are so full of negative energy and polluted soul-pieces that they drag down those who seek enlightenment by their very presence. They are to be avoided - many of them are so polluted they do not recognize the value to be found in a good cleansing, and they do their best to divert the course of the Great Wheel.

Quetzel: The planet to which the Star Father will bring us when we have become Optimized, where we will meet with our starry brethren and join them on their flaming wheels in the sky.

Rim Meat: A basic person, one who has not yet been aligned to purify his neurodynes.

Star Father: Some would call the Star Father "god". We prefer to think of the Star Father as the universal force from which we draw our energy, and to which we feed our energy in turn - again, a cyclical relationship.

Uplifting: The time when the Star Father calls us home to Quetzel, where we meet our extra-terrestrial brethren and move closer to the hub of the Great Wheel. Those who have made an effort to understand and embrace the words of the Hub, no matter their AHS levels, will be invited to join the Star Father in the heavens on planet Quetzel.

Zeta Scan: Another word for "alignment", the Zeta Scan helps to purify your neurodynes and clear your spirit. It consists of a machine that runs massive doses of electricity through your skin - this electricity has been carefully formulated, to the exact volt, to the amount of energy needed to drive the negative energy from a neurodyne. By accepting a Zeta Scan, your course is slightly corrected to be more in line with the movement of the Wheel.

WARNING: If Vault Citizens find it necessary to travel outside of Vault City, they should keep the following list of items on their person:

1. A supply of pre-packaged Vault City-issue rations. Never eat any food offered by an Outsider, as you introduce bacteria or radioactive particles into your system!

2. A geiger counter. Always be certain to monitor ambient radiation levels wherever you travel!

3. At least two stim-packs at all times. The slightest cut or nick could introduce harmful bacteria into your system!

REDDING: Small mining community located west of Vault City. Redding trades gold ore for medical supplies from Vault City. All Vault Citizens are encouraged to exercise extreme caution when travelling inside Redding, as the provincial miners are not strongly governed.
POPULATION: A census is unavailable, but Redding is believed to have hundreds of residents.
GOVERNMENT: Mayor and town council.
BACKGROUND RADIATION COUNT: Current readings are unavailable.
MUTATION RATE: Unknown, believed low.

NEW RENO: City southwest of Vault City. Trades gold ore for medical supplies from Vault City. Reno suffered little structural damage during the war (though looting and property damage have taken their toll), so many streets and buildings remain intact. Warning! There is no central government and no law enforcement. Gambling, prostitution, and drug use are rampant. Vault Citizens are warned to avoid New Reno at ALL costs!
POPULATION: No current census, but believed to be several thousand..."people."
GOVERNMENT: New Reno presently exists in a state of near-anarchy. According to reports, several "crime families" have divided the city amongst themselves.
BACKGROUND RADIATION COUNT: Current readings are unavailable.
MUTATION RATE: Unknown, believed low.

NEW CALIFORNIA REPUBLIC: The territories of NCR are located far to the south of Vault City. Trades mechanical equipment, gold, and various surplus products in exchange for Vault City medical technology. NCR has recently stepped up efforts to absorb Vault City as a border territory, so Vault Citizens should exercise extreme caution when traveling to NCR.
POPULATION: Though a census has been conducted, we do not have access to the figures. NCR is believed to have many tens of thousands of people.
GOVERNMENT: President and a Congress.
BACKGROUND RADIATION COUNT: Current readings are unavailable.
MUTATION RATE: Varies amongst territories.

BROKEN HILLS: A mining community to the south of Vault City that mines uranium ore. The ore is traded to Vault City in exchange for medical supplies, mostly RadX and RadAway. Humans are believed to be forced to live with mutants and ghouls within the town. Due to the nature of the inhabitants and the high probability of contamination, Vault Citizens should avoid Broken Hills at ALL costs!
POPULATION: No current census, bu believed to be in the hundreds of residents.
GOVERNMENT: Rumor has it a MUTANT serves as the First Citizen of this community. This is extremely unlikely, as most mutants are incapable of higher reasoning. If this rumor IS true, it is another reason to avoid Broken Hills altogether.
BACKGROUND RADIATION COUNT: Current readings are unavailable. Believed high.
MUTATION RATE: Believed high. Broken Hills most likely has a high rate of degenerative mutations.

VAULT CITY: This utopia is free from crimes and other sociological ills that inflict the other communities in Northern California. It has existed independent since its emergence from Vault 8, and maintains a thriving economy based on exporting medical technology to Outsider communities in Northern California. All Citizens are encouraged to remain in Vault City whenever possible.
POPULATION: Current Census 103 Citizens.
GOVERNMENT: First Citizen and Council.

We're Here! Why not join us?

There's a wonderful future ahead - and it could be yours with the New California Republic!

But what is it, you want to know?

HOW BIG IS NCR?
Founded eighty years ago, the NCR is now comprised of the states of Shady, Hub, and Dayglow.  Approximately 700,000 citizens are pleased to call NCR home.

WHAT DOES NCR STAND FOR?
The New California Republic is dedicated to bringing peace, security and justice to the people of the great west.  NCR's fine police forces constantly patrol and arrest any raiders, cannibals, slaverd, and lawless mutants within the country, and the NCR army valiantly protects the borders against outside marauders. To ensure justice and liberty, all citizens have access to NCR's courts and the right to vote for a representative of their choice to sit in the Hall of Congress. In the words of President Tandi, "A safe people is a strong people."

WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE?
NCR may be a bit different from what you're used to. There are no chieftains, town bosses, kings, or dictators here. Our leaders are elected by the people! That's right -- every state has the right to send representatives to the Hall of Congress. These representatives select the President and Vice-President to head the council and it is their advice which guides the President's decisions. For ten terms now, President Tandi has been the unanimous choice of the council, who respect her wisdom and foresight.

SOUNDS GREAT! HOW DO I JOIN THE NCR?
All law-abiding and peaceful people, human or mutant, are eligible to become citizens of NCR. To become a citizen all you have to do is move to NCR and present your claim for immigration. After citizenship training and processing your application, you will be notified of your new status as a PC (Provisional Citizen). From there, it's only a short step to full citizenship!

Of course, NCR is not for everybody - slavers, unreformed mutants, known raiders, and other undesirables need not apply!

BUT WHAT IF MY ENTIRE TOWN WANTS TO JOIN?
Depending on where your town is located, NCR does accept petitions by villages, towns, bases, city-states, even minor kingdoms for annexation by NCR. Once the petition is accepted, NCR will grant your town territorial status. Once the needed police and army presence is established and any banditry or other lawlessness has been dealt with, your village can apply for full statehood in the NCR. It's that simple!

So remember - WE'RE HERE. WHY NOT JOIN US?

The courier has delivered the disk you sent. You were correct, of course. The information should prove most useful at the next council debate. With what you have sent me I'm certain I can hinder, if not thwart, any further attempts at an NCR/New Reno Alliance.

I can only assure you that if given my way as I expect, there will be no more interference or provocation by the NCR in any of Vault City's affairs. I, for one, respect your sovereignty, and do not agree with the troublemakers who wish to deprive our innocent neighbors of their freedoms.

It's been a long wait, and the work that has made this possible has been difficult. At times it seemed impossible, however through the brave and tireless efforts of our own head of the Chemical Corps, Dr. Charles Curling, the hour of our salvation is now at hand.

Brave, steadfast, blah, blah, blah. Jeez, does anyone really listen to this stuff?

{371}{}{Memo: The Projects, Quarterly Status Brief
From: Lt. Col., Dr Charles Curling, U.S. Chemical Corps.
To: Cabinet
Subject: Project near reaching full operational status.

It is my honor, and happy privilege, to report the near completion of The Project. After years of work, we've managed to isolate the most toxic elements of the F.E.V. virus. Some of the only recently decoded information that we retrieved from the abandoned military base on the mainland has been instrumental in advancing our research.

We've discovered that the F.E.V. virus was not originally designed to be used as an agent for the creation of super-soldiers. Initially, it appears, the F.E.V. was designed as a virulent toxin. Only later was the F.E.V. virus manipulated in an attempt to create super-soldiers.

By backtracking somewhat in our research, and with the help of the additional information from the military base's records, we've been able to turn our version of the F.E.V. (F.E.V. Curling-13) into a far more toxic agent.

Final tests conducted on the vault-descendant subjects, from the village "Arroyo," have shown a survival rate of zero-percent, with most deaths occurring within one-hour of exposure to a .0001% aerosol solution. By contrast, the subjects extracted from Vault 13 tend to suffer subdural hemorrhaging and convulsions within one-hour of exposure, with death not occurring, on average, for another 14.5-hours.

In either case, the F.E.V.'s toxicity levels are now sufficient to insure a "clean-sweep" of all infested (i.e. non-Enclave) locales. Current releasable levels of F.E.V. Curling-13 show a 95% probability of .00007% average saturation. While the consensus of the Chemical Corps is that this would be a sufficient level to insure the success of the Project, we believe that it is worth waiting until we can accumulate enough F.E.V. toxin to reach our .0001% saturation and 99.5% extermination level goal.

Current F.E.V. Curling-13, production levels show that we'll reach our release goal, of 250,000 gallons, within six weeks.

Congratulations, ladies and gentlemen, our long years of work are nearly at an end.
God bless America.}

{381}{}{Memo: A.E.C., Status Brief
From: Tom Murray, Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission
To: Cabinet
Subject: Danger of overdependence  upon central computer for all reactor control.

NOTE to the CABINET: I hate to be a nag by bringing this up all the time, but I cannot overemphasize the importance of diversifying our Atomic Powerplant's control systems. Here's my official report. I think that once you read it, you'll understand why we need to have a backup system.
--Tom

Atomic Energy Reactor Regulator
------------------------------------------
Vault-Tec's new Uranium Nuclear Reactor has been working to top efficiency so far. With the state of the art computer systems that were made specifically for the task of regulating the coolant temperature as well as many other key functions, we are able to allow the reactor to run with minimal supervision.

The new Synchronic multi-processors that we had built into the tri-processor motherboard are able to multitask the coolant temperature, the intake of cool sea water, the outtake of expended coolant and waste from the reactions, and the regulation of the neutron bombardment upon the uranium. Without the computer systems, the reactor would go out of balance almost immediately, causing a chain-reaction bombardment of the uranium isotopes. Within two hours, or less, this would result in a nuclear explosion equivalent in the 100-kiloton range.

The sum of the main portions of the reactor are placed underwater, beneath the station. This arrangement allows the ocean's natural temperature to keep the exterior cooler. Seawater, from 500 meters, is pumped into the coolant chamber. A portion of the cool seawater is diverted to the containment unit, where the core and control rods are. There, it circulates through the core, becoming heated from the nuclear reaction taking place. The seawater reaches the boiling point and the resulting steam is used to turn the turbine generator to create all of our electricity. The steam then condenses and returns to a filter tank. The cleansed water is entered back into a preparation tank, ready to start the cycle all over again.

Severely radiated water, and miscellaneous toxic materials, are pumped out of the station through a waste-conduit, terminating one mile to the south. Reports from our survey crews state that our effluvia drifts down the coast of southern California and Mexico, causing irreversible ecological damage. Many of the beaches are now saturated with toxic waste, and highly radiated sea life. Fortunately, this doesn't effect us.

In any case, if our reactor is shut down, we do have some backup batteries that can be used to power vital systems throughout the Enclave until power is restored. However, these do not include extraneous and high energy items such as forcefields. Also, as a safety precaution, certain watertight doors throughout the station, will close when power is reduced (to prevent flooding in case of an emergency). This will restrict movement through the station but movement to the top of the station is still possible, through alternate routes.

The real problem is that if the computer is shut down or destroyed, unlikely though both of those events may be, the reactor will go critical to the point of meltdown within two-hours. We need to install some sort of a human-maintained backup system. I know that you may think I'm an alarmist for bringing up these provisions for an unthinkable event, however it always pays to be prepared.

In the meantime, let's just make sure no one blows up our computer (hah, hah).

Yours, Tom Murray, Chairman, A.E.C.}

{391}{}{Journal of Sir Latham, Entry 10.1.4.
We have crash landed north of a camp occupied by Super Mutants. We believe these to be remnants of the Master's army as encountered by the first Vault Dweller. Although the archives mentioned that some of these Super Mutants might actually be friendly, we found little to like about these ones, especially the chief. 
The leader of this camp went by the name of Gammorin. We were set upon by his patrols soon after we pulled ourselves from the wreckage. Bound and gagged, the mutant guards dragged us back to their camp. Fully half of us had been killed by the crash, and now less than half of that survived the treatment of our mutant captors. 
We were scheduled to be killed for the amusement of Gammorin. It was not hard to see that several of the Super-Mutants were unhappy with this. In fact, I was amazed to discover that they were not as savage as I had been previously lead to believe. 
I challenged Gammorin to single unarmed combat. It was to the death. There could be no other outcome in my mind. If I die, it will in combat. 

Journal of Sir Latham, Entry 0.0.1.
I am awake. 
To tell the truth, I remember little of the battle. The gash on my head, along with multiple fractures and breaks, paint an adequate picture. However, the mutants are now expecting me to lead them since I laid Gammorin to rest. I will record more later. I fear my brain has been set awry by the fight. I will try to rest until I can think clearly. 

Journal of Sir Latham, Entry 0.5.8.
The Super Mutants are a simple but good people. While considered stupid by many, they show a loyalty stronger than I have seen in many humans. They live life the only way they know how. 
I have begun to organize these Mutant forces with the handful of fellow humans who survived the crash. I have recovered physically but I find myself prone to mysterious fits of anger and depression. But much worse are the hallucinations. 

Journal of Sir Latham, Entry 1.4.5.
Today is a day filled with absolute horror. 
Only one mutant returned from a scouting trip that was ten soldiers strong. He staggered back to camp and collapsed without a sound. He died in my arms while trying to hold back the blood pouring from his mouth. 
Before I had a chance to close his eyes, the menace was upon us! Metallic death machines entered the camp undetected by my sentries! I have never seen creatures such as this before, but they seemed unstoppable. It was only the sheer power and, more importantly, our numbers that allowed us to defeat these three machinations of death. 
Our losses were staggering. 

Journal of Sir Latham, Entry 1.8.2.
We are resting now. Humans and mutants alike, hanging their heads and trying to catch their breath. Who knows how far we retreated? Twenty miles? Forty even? 
Once we put enough distance between us and this... this Menace from the West, then we can regroup and plan a counter-strike. 

Journal of Sir Latham, Entry 2.3.4.
I am not well. This morning I thought I was attacked by a Deathclaw. Too far from my SMG, I lashed out with my Ripper, slashing the beast's throat. My vision cleared in time to see Nathan the scribe's eyes go cloudy. His neck in ruin, his blood covering my hands. How can I go mad when humanity is in such dire peril? 
I must maintain my sanity. I must. 

Journal of Sir Latham, Entry 2.4.2.
My scouts engaged an enemy today. The sound of chain guns and explosions hasting my steps. What I observed in that fight changed me to the core of my being. 
My mutant scouts were engaged by a Brotherhood patrol. For the first time in my life, I was frozen in battle. 
I watched, curious even, tribal looking Brotherhood soldiers laughing manically as they cut down my new companions. 
My mutant companions, who dedicated their life to me as their leader. I lifted my weapon then, and fired again and again. 
When it was over, with Brotherhood corpses littering the ground, my head suddenly cleared. I now know my purpose and, more importantly, I finally know who I am. 
I am Gammorin - sworn enemy of the Menace from the West.}

Furthermore, the subterranean Vault compartments that were designated for backup computer and life support systems will now be renovated for senior vault personnel leisure facilities. 
The committee has a construction agenda that must be finalized by mid March. The new facility options are as follows; several top quality restaurants with 10,000 square feet of cold storage, seven smoke rooms with piano bars and two subterranean hunting grounds stocked with rare animals purchased from world renowned zoos.

...good question, Dr. Jones. I would be happy to explain why we're taking "the path less traveled" when compared to mundane computer systems. 
One advantage the Calculator has over normal computers is the electro-organic linking terminal. Our tests conclude that the CPU can share tasks and receive data from pseudo cryogenic stored brains that are maintained in an oxygenated tank. 
These brains are currently that of lab rodents, but our calculations indicate that human brains can be preserved in the same fashion. The brains will be fed specifically formulated nutrients to sustain suspended life. In turn, they will assist the Calculator's CPU in Vault management, including life support, food production and distribution, Pacification-Robot protocol, and Vault-0 defenses. 
This neural network will also assist in Vault-0's primary function: To initiate Mankind's post-war rebirth. When outside temperature, radiation levels, and poison particle counts return to acceptable levels, Vault-0 will remotely activate the Exodus Protocol, which will initialize the integration of all Vault Dwellers onto the planet's surface. 
The brains are to be harvested from a select group of geniuses that were chosen, by committee, for their skills and their cute haircuts... (fade to static).

The attacks have been getting worse. I know you have your own problems with those elitist assholes from

mutants. I don't understand where they're coming from, but we have so much trouble stopping them. 
Then there's the raiders. As often as they attack, I don't see why we aren't all dead yet. Maybe they 
keep some of us alive just so they can keep coming back and robbing us. What's really pushed it too far 
though is the recent spike in random murders. It happens far too often-some asshole will come through with 
some sort of automatic weapon, usually a minigun. Without warning they start firing, with no real target 
or motive. It's the most horrifying thing you've ever seen. What seems to be just another wanderer turns into a 
one-man-army. Broken Hills could care less what happens to us, as long as they have their uranium. The NCR Army
